	<p>My wondering thoughts and projects that help fix the internet one thing at a time. I am LAMP/node.js developer based in Bournemouth and I have a lovely family with my partner Sophie and our incredible three childen.</p>

	<p>Building and maintaining backend systems is where I like to operate and improving developers workflows is something I love doing. I'm a big supporter of the open source community and constantly read Hacker News to read up about new tech and startups.</p>
