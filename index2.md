## About Me

My wondering thoughts and projects that help fix the internet one thing at a time. I am LAMP/node.js developer based in Bournemouth and I have a lovely family with my partner Sophie and our incredible threee childen.

Building and maintaining backend systems is where I like to operate and improving developers workflows is something I love doing. I'm a big supporter of the open source community and constantly read Hacker News to read up about new tech and startups.
